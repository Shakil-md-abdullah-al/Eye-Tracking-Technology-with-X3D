<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
</hr>

In this scop, I have built two websites. At first in the static part, I only made a prototype design of my main website. It is a conceptual website that works with 3d models along with the user perception of on website. How does a user reacts with the product image and what for the 3D model? I have used the Gazerecorder tool for it and collected user reviews and eye-tracking survey for it. Due to file size, I can't upload the x3d file on [![GitHub Follow](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Follow%20Me-black?logo=github&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/Shakil-md-abdullah-al) 
and so I have attached it in the following link: </br>

<h2>5. Additional</h2>
</hr>
You can use  3D models from <a herf="https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/spider-man-2-style-headphones-ca22cba6330e49e7b3a00e543d542131#download">this link </a> or can make your model. I have developd my model with Cinema$D and from the website.
